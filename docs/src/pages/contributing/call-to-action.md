## Helping out

This **Call to action** page is where items can be listed where community involvement will be greatly appreciated. In this respect, so that more time can be devoted to the components and not the docs site. If you take something on, please coordinate in the [Discussions](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qmediaplayer/discussions) area so there are not duplicated efforts.

### Docs site

The Docs site has several empty pages that need to be filled in. If you think you are up to it, pick one and help out.

### Testing

It'd be very welcomed if someone could write up tests for the UI component.
